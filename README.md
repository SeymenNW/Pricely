 <h1 align="center">Pricely 1.2</h1> <p align="center"> Pricely 1.2 is completely rewritten. It now includes a custom search engine (instead of just using PriceRunner). PriceRunner/Klarna is still supported and the plan is to add support for more Comparison sites. The Frontend is now in Angular instead of Blazor. And the project structure now tries to adhere to SOLID fundamentals.

Currently the supported merchants are: Power, Proshop, Elgiganten, Komplett, MaxGaming, Alternate, CompuMail, ComputerSalg and FÃ¸niks Computer.
