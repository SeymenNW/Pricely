## Pricely 1.0

### What is Pricely?

Pricely is a price comparison tool that gathers product data from various companies. Its purpose is to show you the most accurate prices, free from ads and tracking. Pricely is fair and independent of specific companies.

## What does it do?

### No Tracking

Pricely retrieves product data without trackers, allowing search freely without being tracked. All data is fetched on the server and passed to the client, meaning no tracking from services like Klarna, Google, Adform, Facebook, TikTok, etc.
